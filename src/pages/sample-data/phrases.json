  "GM. Woke up Rudish. I mean... Bullish!",
  "We're not scared of those little demons. They're more like ankle-biters than anything.",
  "The only thing scarier than a Golem is a Golem trying to run. Have you seen how slow they move?",
  "The Golems may be big, but they're also big targets. Makes it easy.",
  "I don't know what's worse - being hit by a Golem, or being hugged by one.",
  "Demons may be quick, but they're also quick to fall.",
  "We're not just rude. We're confident, bold, and ready to take on anything.",
  "GM. Say it back.",
  "The Hub is way too cool, y'all should check it out.",
  "Rude Golems don't just talk a big game. We back it up with actions.",
  "A Rude Golem isn't just a character - it's a way of life.",
  "When I wake up Rudish, I know it's going to be a bullish day.",
  "When life gets tough, I channel my inner Golem and push through any obstacle.",
  "When you're a Rude Golem, there's no such thing as too heavy - only too easy.",
  "The Rude Golem community is a family of rock-solid warriors.",
  "My Rude is my partner in crime",
  "My Golem is a constant reminder that there's strength in unity and community.",
  "The future is bright for Rude Golems and Demons."
